# SchedulrX
A Flask web app that allows users to book appointments, saves them in JSON, shows all bookings, and uses model reggression to find and recommend the least popular times (like for example if no one books on tuesdays 8 am it will suggest that or vice versa if saturdays are super busy no reccomeding saturdays) 
In additon it will only book during office hours, its a shropt learning project i did to undrestand MLs and Flask some more.
